## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

### About This Challenge

Frontend Mentor challenges help improve my coding skills by building realistic projects. For this challenge, I needed a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

### The Challenge

My task was to build out this feature section and make it look as close to the design as possible.

### How I Did It

1. **Tools and Technologies:**
   - **HTML:** To create the structure of the feature section.
   - **CSS:** To style the section and match it to the provided design.
   - **Git and GitHub:** For version control and code sharing.

2. **Process:**
   - First, I studied the design provided in the `/design` folder.
   - I created the basic HTML structure of the feature section.
   - Using CSS, I styled the section, focusing on details such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`.
   - I implemented responsive design techniques to ensure the section looks good on different screen sizes.
   - I made sure that the layout adapts optimally depending on the device's screen size.

### Functionality

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
