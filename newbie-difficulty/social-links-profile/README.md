My task was to create this social profile links page and make it as close to the design as possible.

2. **Process:**
   - First, I studied the designs located in the `/design` folder.
   - I created the basic HTML structure of the page according to the design.
   - Using CSS, I styled the page, paying attention to the correct font-size, padding, and margin.
   - I added interactive elements like cursor and focus states for all interactive elements.
