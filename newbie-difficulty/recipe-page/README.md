## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

### About This Challenge

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) help improve coding skills by creating realistic projects. For this challenge, I needed basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

### The Challenge

My task was to build out this recipe page and make it as close to the design as possible.

### How I Did It

1. **Tools and Technologies:**
   - **HTML:** To create the structure of the page.
   - **CSS:** To style the page and achieve a design as close to the original as possible.
   - **Git and GitHub:** For version control and code sharing.

2. **Process:**
   - First, I studied the designs located in the `/design` folder.
   - I created the basic HTML structure of the page according to the design.
   - Using CSS, I styled the page, paying attention to the correct `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`.
